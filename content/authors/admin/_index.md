I am a PhD student studying physical oceanography at the University of Oxford. I am based at the department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics (AOPP) and a student of the Environmental Research DTP.

I take an interest in the fluid dynamics of the ocean circulation. I study the dynamics of ocean gyres and how they are influenced by both mesoscale eddies and interactions with the sea floor.
I design idealized models, develop diagnostic methods, and use pen-and-paper analysis to find minimal descriptions of ocean processes seen in models and observations. 

My current research project is a collaboration between the University of Oxford and the Met Office.
