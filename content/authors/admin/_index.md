I am a DPhil (PhD) student studying physical oceanography at the University of Oxford, where I am supervised by [David Marshall](https://www.marshallocean.net/) and [Mike Bell](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/mike-bell).

<!-- I am based at the department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics (AOPP) and I am a student of the NERC Environmental Research DTP. -->

My research is all about the fluid dynamics of the ocean and how important circulations are represented in ocean models. 

I study the dynamics of ocean gyres and how they are influenced by eddy activity, the sea floor, and buoyancy forcing. I tackle this research question by designing idealized models, developing diagnostic methods, analyzing Lagrangian trajectories, and exploring possibilities with pen and paper analysis.

Please reach out to me if you would like to meet or collaborate!
