It has been an incredible and jam-packed week in Paris. The joint meetings for [SO-CHIC](http://www.sochic-h2020.eu/) and [OCEAN:ICE](https://www.europeanpolarboard.org/projects/oceanice/) showcased some great science and I have met some incredible people. I was introduced to some exciting new observational datasets and I have learned so much about polynyas and their impact on the ocean and atmosphere.

On Thursday, I shared some results from my idealized model of the Weddell Gyre and you can find the slides [here](IWG_presentation.pdf). I am now very energized to get this article written so keep an eye out for the preprint!

It was also my pleasure to share the poster from my [recent publication](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021MS002884) about spurious forces. You can find a digital copy of the poster [here](AndrewStylesSpuriousForcesPoster.pdf).
