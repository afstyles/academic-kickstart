I have a very exciting week lined up ahead of me. The joint meetings for [SO-CHIC](http://www.sochic-h2020.eu/) and [OCEAN:ICE](https://www.europeanpolarboard.org/projects/oceanice/) are taking place at Sorbonne University in Paris.

On Thursday, I will be sharing some results from my idealized model of the Weddell Gyre. I am currently writing an article for these new results and a preprint will be available soon so keep an eye out!

I will also be giving a poster presentation on my [recent publication](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021MS002884) about spurious forces in ocean gyres.
