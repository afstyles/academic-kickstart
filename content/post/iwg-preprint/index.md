I am excited to announce that I have submitted my second paper to JGR: Oceans and the preprint is now available on ESS Open Archive.

Use the link below to take a look!

In this paper, we use an idealized model of the Weddell Gyre and find that it is extremely sensitive to horizontal resolution. In particular, the gyre transport is largest at eddy-permitting resolutions, where only the largest mesoscale eddies are resolved.
