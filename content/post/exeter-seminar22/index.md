This week I will be presenting a seminar for the Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics group at the University of Exeter.

The seminar will be an in-depth study of ocean gyres and their vorticity budget and is largely based on my [recently published paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021MS002884).

If you are in Exeter, head over to the Harrison building on the 4th October at 14:30 BST to catch the talk. 

More details can be found [here](https://mathematics.exeter.ac.uk/research/cgafd/seminars/event/?semID=2801&dateID=5770).
