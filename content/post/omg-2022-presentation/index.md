I am very excited to be presenting in the [Challenger Society Ocean Modelling annual meeting](https://www.challenger-society.org.uk/Ocean_Modelling) at the Natural History Museum in London.

I will be presenting my work on spurious forces in the afternoon session (9th September 13:30 - 15:30 GMT)

Despite my best efforts, I cannot guarantee that dinosaurs will be featured in my presentation!
