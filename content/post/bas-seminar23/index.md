This week I will be visiting the British Antarctic Survey for two days (31st May - 1st June). If you are at BAS or Cambridge and would like to meet, let me know!

On **Wednesday 31st May at 3 pm (BST)** I will be presenting at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) as part of the Polar Ocean seminar series (link [here](https://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/201595)).

The seminar is all about the idealized model of the Weddell Gyre that I created and have used throughout my PhD. I will show how this model is extremely sensitive to horizontal resolution and that eddy-permitting (1/4 degree) resolutions can be particularly problematic.

The seminar will be based on my **paper** that is under review at **JGR: Oceans** (link to **preprint** [here](https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.167591042.21189159/v1)).
