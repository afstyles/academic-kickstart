This year I will be presenting my work at the EGU 2022 conference in Vienna.

I will be presenting my work on spurious forces in the Numerical Modelling of the Ocean session (link [here](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/session/42215)).

My presentation will be on **Wednesday, 25th May at 08:50 CEST in Room 1.15/16**.

See you in Vienna (or online)!
