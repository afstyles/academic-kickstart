This year I will be presenting my work at the AGU 2022 conference in Chicago.

I will be presenting two posters:

* My recently published work on spurious forces in the Community Modeling and Open Innovation session on **Wednesday, 14th December at 14:45-18:15 CT** (link [here](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1071779)).

* Recent results from an idealized model of the Weddell Gyre that demonstrate an extreme sensitivity to resolution on **Friday, 16th December at 14:45-18:15 CT** (link [here](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1071718))


See you in Chicago (or online)!
