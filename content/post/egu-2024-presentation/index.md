This year I will be returning to Vienna to presenting my work at the EGU 2024 conference.

I will be presenting some early work in the OceanBound projct (link [here](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-4119.html)), an ambitious project to rediscover the global ocean through the lens of boundary pressures. 

My presentation will be on **Monday, 15th April at 17:00 CEST in Room L3**.

See you in Vienna (or online)!
