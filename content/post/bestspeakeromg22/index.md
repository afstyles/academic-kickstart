The Ocean Modelling SIG was a fantastic meeting, jam-packed with great talks. 

It is therefore a great honour to win the prize for best talk at the meeting alongside [Andrea Rochner](https://twitter.com/AndreaROcean) from Exeter 

Unfortunately a recording of the talk is not available but the slides can be found [here](OMSIG22-AndrewStyles-SpuriousForces.pdf).
