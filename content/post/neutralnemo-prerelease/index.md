About a year ago, I had an idea for a Python package but I couldn't quite find the time (probably because I was writing a thesis). Either way, I am glad to finally share **neutralNEMO** with the world.

**neutralNEMO** is a Python library which helps users calculate neutral surfaces from NEMO model outputs. 

* The **GitHub repository** can be found here: [https://github.com/afstyles/neutralNEMO](https://github.com/afstyles/neutralNEMO)

* **Documentation** including installation instructions can be found here: [https://neutralnemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://neutralnemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Further details can also be found on the dedicated [neutralNEMO page](/neutralnemo/)
