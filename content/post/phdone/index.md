After four years I have finally finished my PhD at the University of Oxford. An enormous thanks to my two fantastic supervisors, [David Marshall](https://www.marshallocean.net/) and [Mike Bell](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/mike-bell), for their guidance and support. I must also thank my two examiners, [Alberto Naveira Garabato](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5x2hkq/professor-alberto-naveira-garabato#publications) and [Andrew Wells](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/wellsa). 

I am taking some much-needed time off, but I will be starting a very unique research project very soon. Stay tuned for more details!
