Tomorrow (**Tuesday, 27th June**) I will be visiting Southampton to give a seminar at **11am** in the National Oceanography Centre. If you are in Southampton and would like to meet, let me know!

The seminar is all about the idealized model of the Weddell Gyre that I created and have used throughout my PhD. I will show how this model is extremely sensitive to horizontal resolution and that eddy-permitting (1/4 degree) resolutions can be particularly problematic.

The seminar will be based on my **paper** that is under review at **JGR: Oceans** (link to **preprint** [here](https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.167591042.21189159/v1)).
