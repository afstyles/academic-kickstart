On Tuesday this week I will be presenting at the University of Liverpool as part of the Ocean seminar series.

The seminar is all about the idealized model of the Weddell Gyre that I created and have used throughout my PhD. I will show how this model is extremely sensitive to horizontal resolution and that eddy-permitting (1/4 degree) resolutions can be particularly problematic.

The seminar will be based on the paper I have submitted to JGR: Oceans (preprint [here](https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.167591042.21189159/v1)) which has just received some very positive reviews!
