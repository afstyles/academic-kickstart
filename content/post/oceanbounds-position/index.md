After enjoying a bit of [post-PhD](/post/phdone/) relaxation, I have now started as a Physical Oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey.

I am leading the adjoint component of *OceanBound*, an ambitious project to study the role of ocean boundary pressures in the global ocean. As an adjoint modeller, I will be using the ECCO state estimate to determine which external forces the boundary pressures are most sensitive to. 

The British Antarctic Survey has been a welcoming place to work where everyone is perhaps a little bit too obsessed (if that's possible) with Antarctica. I am also enjoying a close collaboration with the University of Liverpool as part of the OceanBound project.
